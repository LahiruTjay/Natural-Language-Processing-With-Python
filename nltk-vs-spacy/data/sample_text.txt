The performance of these simple machine learning algorithms depends heavily on the representation of the data they are given. For example, when logistic regression is used to recommend cesarean delivery, the AI system does not examinethe patient directly. Instead, the doctor tells the system several pieces of relevant information, such as the presence or absence of a uterine scar. Each piece of information included in the representation of the patient is known as afeature. Logistic regression learns how each of these features of the patient correlates with various outcomes. However, it cannot inﬂuence how features are deﬁned in anyway. If logistic regression were given an MRI scan of the patient, rather thanthe doctor’s formalized report, it would not be able to make useful predictions. Individual pixels in an MRI scan have negligible correlation with any complications that might occur during delivery.This dependence on representations is a general phenomenon that appears throughout computer science and even daily life. In computer science, operations such as searching a collection of data can proceed exponentially faster if the collection is structured and indexed intelligently. People can easily perform arithmetic on Arabic numerals but ﬁnd arithmetic on Roman numerals much more time consuming. It is not surprising that the choice of representation has an enormous eﬀect on the performance of machine learning algorithms. For a simple visual example, see ﬁgure 1.1. Many artiﬁcial intelligence tasks can be solved by designing the right set offeatures to extract for that task, then providing these features to a simple machine learning algorithm. For example, a useful feature for speaker identiﬁcation from sound is an estimate of the size of the speaker’s vocal tract. This feature gives astrong clue as to whether the speaker is a man, woman, or child.
